# LabPack-C: A LabVIEW-Friendly C library for encoding and decoding MessagePack data

## What is LabPack-C?

The LabPack-C project is a [LabVIEW](http://www.ni.com/labview)-friendly C library for encoding and decoding [MessagePack](http://www.msgpack.org) data. The library is intended to be used with the [Call Library Function](http://zone.ni.com/reference/en-XX/help/371361P-01/glang/call_library_function/) node. This provides MessagePack encoding and decoding functionality to LabVIEW as a Dynamic Link Library (DLL, Windows), Dynamic Library (Dylib, macOS), and/or Shared Object (SO, Linux).

## Install

A single ZIP archive containing the pre-compiled/built shared libraries for all of the platforms listed in the [Build](#build) section is provided with each [release](https://github.com/fieldrndservices/labpack-c/releases).

1. Download the ZIP archive for the latest release. Note, this is _not_ the source code ZIP file. The ZIP archive containing the pre-compiled/built shared libraries will be labeled: `labpack-c_#.#.#.zip`, where `#.#.#` is the version number for the release.
2. Extract, or unzip, the ZIP archive.
3. Copy and paste all or the platform-specific shared libraries to one of the following locations on disk:

| Platform    | Destination           |
|-------------|-----------------------|
| Windows     | `C:\Windows\System32` |
| macOS       | `/usr/local/lib`      |
| Linux       | `/usr/local/lib`      |
| NI Linux RT | `/usr/local/lib`      |

## Build

Ensure all of the following dependencies are installed and up-to-date before proceeding:

- [CMake 3.9.x](https://cmake.org/), or newer
- [Microsoft Visual C++ Build Tools 2017](https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/#build-tools-for-visual-studio-2017), Windows Only
- [XCode Command Line Tools](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/features/), macOS Only
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [C/C++ Development Tools for NI Linux Real-Time, Eclipse Edition 2017](http://www.ni.com/download/labview-real-time-module-2017/6731/en/), NI Linux RT only

### Windows

The [Microsoft Visual C++ Build Tools 2017](https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/#build-tools-for-visual-studio-2017) should have installed a `x64 Native Build Tools` command prompt. Start the `x64 Native Build Tools` command prompt. This ensures the appropriate C compiler is available to CMake to build the library. Run the following commands to obtain a copy of the source code and build both the 32-bit and 64-bit DLLs with a `Release` configuration:

    > git clone https://github.com/fieldrndservices/labpack-c.git LabPack-C
    > cd LabPack-c
    > build.bat

The DLLs will be available in the `build32\bin` and `build64\bin` folders. 

### macOS

Ensure the command-line tools for [XCode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) have been installed along with [git](https://git-scm.com/) before proceeding. Start the Terminal.app. Run the following commands to obtain a copy of the source code from the repository and build the dynamic library (dylib):

    $ git clone https://github.com/fieldrndservices/labpack-c.git LabPack-C
    $ cd LabPack-C
    $ mkdir build && cd build
    $ cmake ..
    $ cd ..
    $ cmake --build build --config Release

The dynamic library (.dylib) will be available in the `build/bin` folder.

### Linux

If running on Ubuntu or similar distribution, ensure the [build-essential](https://packages.ubuntu.com/trusty/build-essential), [cmake](https://packages.ubuntu.com/trusty/cmake), and [git](https://packages.ubuntu.com/trusty/git) packages are installed before proceeding. These can be installed with the following command from a terminal:

    $ sudo apt-get install build-essential cmake git

Start a terminal, and run the following commands to obtain a copy of the source code from the repository and build the shared object (so):

    $ git clone https://github.com/fieldrndservices/labpack-c.git
    $ cd labpack-c
    $ mkdir build && cd build
    $ cmake ..
    $ cd ..
    $ cmake --build build --config Release

The shared object (.so) will be available in the `build/bin` folder.

### NI Linux RT

NI provides a cross-compiler for their Real-Time (RT) Linux distribution. Before proceeding, download and install the [C/C++ Development Tools for NI Linux Real-Time, Eclipse Edition 2017](http://www.ni.com/download/labview-real-time-module-2017/6731/en/). It is also best to review the [Getting Stared with C/C++ Development Tools for NI Linux Real-Time, Eclipse Edition](http://www.ni.com/tutorial/14625/en/) guide for more general information about configuring the internal builder.

1. Start NI Eclipse. A _Workspace Launcher_ dialog may appear. Use the default.
2. A welcome screen may appear after the application has loaded. Close the welcome screen.
3. Right-click in the _Project Explorer_ on the left and select _Import_ from the context menu that appears. A new dialog will appear.
4. Select `Git->Projects from Git` from the dialog that appears. Click the _Next >_ button. A new page will appear.
5. Select the `Clone URI` from the list that appears in the new page of the dialog. Click the _Next >_ button. A new page will appear.
6. Enter the URI for the git repository in the _URI:_ field, i.e. `https://github.com/fieldrndservices/labpack-c.git`. The _Host:_ and _Repository path:_ fields will populate automatically. Click the _Next >_ button. A new page will appear.
7. Ensure only the `master` checkbox is checked in the _Branch Selection_ page of the _Import Projects from Git_ dialog. Click the _Next >_ button. A new page will appear.
8. Browse to the workspace directory for NI Eclipse to populate the _Directory:_ field. Leave all other fields as the defaults. Click the _Next >_ button. A new page will appear.
9. Select the `Import existing projects` radio button from the options under the _Wizard for project import_ section. Click the _Next >_ button. A new page will appear.
10. Click the _Finish_ button. No changes are needed on the _Import Projects_ page. A new `labpack-c` project should appear in the _Project Explorer_.
11. Click the _Build_ toolbar button (icon is a small hammer) to build the NI Linux RT x86_64-based shared object (so).
12. Click the drop-down menu next to the _Build_ toolbar button and select the `ARM` build configuration. This will build the NI Linux RT ARM-based shared object (so).

Note, steps 3-10 only need to be done once to setup the project. The `liblabpack-rt.so` will be located in the `x86_64` folder under the project's root folder inside the Eclipse workspace folder, and the `liblabpack-arm-rt.so` will be located in the `ARM` folder under the project's root folder inside the Eclipse workspace folder.

## Tests

All of the tests are located in the `tests` folder. The tests are organized in "modules", where an executable is created that tests each source "module", i.e. writer, reader, etc. The tests are separated from the source, but the tests are built as part of build for the shared library. Each test executable is located in the `bin\tests` folder of the build directory and they can be run independently.

If the `ctest`, or `make test` on non-Windows systems, commands are used _after_ building the tests to run the tests, then the [ctest](https://cmake.org/Wiki/CMake/Testing_With_CTest) test runner framework is used to run the tests. This provides a very high level summary of the results of running all tests. Since the tests are organized into "modules" and suites, the [ctest](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.9/manual/ctest.1.html) command only indicates that a test within a module and suite has failed. It does _not_ indicate which test has failed. To investigate the failed test, the executable in the `bin\tests` folder for test module should be run. For example, if a test in the writer module failed, the ctest test runner will indicate the "writer" test has failed. The `bin\tests\writer` executable should then be run as a standalone application without the ctest test runner to obtain information about which test and assertion failed.

### Windows

Start a terminal command prompt and navigate to the root folder of the project. Note, if following from the [Build](#build) instructions, a command prompt should already be available at the root folder of the project. Enter the following commands to run the tests:

```text
> ctest -C "Debug"
```

Or

```text
> bin\reader
> bin\writer
> bin\status
```

### macOS

Start the Terminal.app. Note, if following from the [Build](#build) instructions, the Terminal.app has already been started and the present working directory (pwd) should already be the root folder of the project. Enter the following commands to run the tests:

    $ ctest

Or,

    $ bin/tests/reader
    $ bin/tests/writer
    $ bin/tests/status

Or,

    $ make test

### Linux

Start a terminal. Note, if following from the [Build](#build) instructions, the terminal has already been started and the present working directory (pwd) should already be the root folder of the project. Enter the following commands to run the tests:

    $ ctest

Or,

    $ bin/tests/reader
    $ bin/tests/writer
    $ bin/tests/status

Or,

    $ make test

## Documentation

[Doxygen](http://www.doxygen.org) is used to build the Application Programming Interface (API) documentation. Ensure the latest version is installed then enter the following command to build the documentation:

    $ mkdir -p build/docs/html
    $ doxygen docs/Doxyfile

The output will be in the `build/docs/html` folder of the root directory of the project.
